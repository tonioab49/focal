title: Add "New Task" and "New Document" creation flow
status: done
priority: high
---

## Description

Users have no way to create tasks or documents from the UI — they must manually create MDX files on disk. Add a keyboard-driven creation flow for both content types.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Press `N` on the Kanban board → opens a "New Task" modal
- [ ] Press `N` on a docs page → opens a "New Document" modal
- [ ] Modal shows a single title input (auto-focused), nothing else
- [ ] Enter submits; Escape cancels
- [ ] On submit, the file is created on disk and the user is redirected to the standard edit view
- [ ] Filename is derived from the title (slugified)
- [ ] New tasks default to `status: todo`
- [ ] The `N` shortcut is listed in the shortcut help panel (`?`)
