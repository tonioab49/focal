## Description

Set up Playwright and write end-to-end tests covering the core user flows of Focal.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Playwright is installed and configured (`playwright.config.ts`)
- [ ] A CI step runs the Playwright tests
- [ ] Kanban board renders tasks and columns correctly
- [ ] Drag-and-drop between columns updates task status
- [ ] Sidebar navigation works (docs, tasks)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts modal opens and closes
- [ ] Real-time collaboration: changes made in one browser tab appear in another

## Technical Notes

- Use `@playwright/test` with the Next.js dev server (`webServer` option in config)
- Tests should live in `e2e/` at the project root
- Tag smoke tests with `@smoke` so they can be run in isolation
