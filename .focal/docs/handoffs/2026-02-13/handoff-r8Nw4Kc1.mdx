- Goal (1–2 lines)
- Fix TypeScript error: missing required `localMode` prop on `RepoSelector`.
- Ensure project typecheck succeeds.

- Context / assumptions (bullets)
- `RepoSelector` requires `{ repos, selectedRepo, localMode }`.
- Sidebar callsite already passed `localMode`; mobile header callsite in `AppShell` did not.

- Decisions made (bullets)
- Patched only the failing callsite in `src/components/AppShell.tsx`.
- Reused `gitStatus.localMode` already available in `AppShell` props.

- What we tried (bullets)
- Inspected `src/components/AppShell.tsx` and `src/components/RepoSelector.tsx`.
- Added `localMode={gitStatus.localMode}` to mobile header `RepoSelector`.
- Ran `yarn -s tsc --noEmit`.

- Current state (what works / what’s broken)
- Works:
- TypeScript compile error is resolved.
- Full `tsc --noEmit` passes.
- Broken/known issues:
- None found during this scoped fix.

- Open questions / unknowns
- UNKNOWN: none relevant to this patch.

- Next steps (ranked, with concrete commands or file paths)
- 1. Optional smoke test in app mobile layout to confirm selector text in local mode: `yarn dev`.
- 2. Continue with any pending UI refinements in `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` if requested.

- Artifacts (links/paths: PRs, branches, files touched, docs created)
- Modified: `src/components/AppShell.tsx`
- Created: `.focal/docs/handoffs/2026-02-13/handoff-r8Nw4Kc1.mdx`
- Verified with: `yarn -s tsc --noEmit`

- If we resume: “Start by doing X, then Y” (2–5 bullets)
- Start by running the app and checking mobile header rendering.
- Then verify repo selector behavior in local mode and multi-repo mode.
