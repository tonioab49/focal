# Goal

- Inspect and report current linting/coding-standards enforcement posture for the Focal repository, including configured tooling and actual run status.
- Validate what is enforced automatically versus what is only available as manual commands.

# Context / assumptions

- Date of inspection: 2026-02-14.
- Scope inspected: root config (`package.json`, `.eslintrc.json`, `tsconfig.json`), repository automation presence (`.github`, `.husky`), and current command outcomes.
- Assumed package manager in use is Yarn based on project metadata and lockfile.
- Assumed “coding standards” includes linting, formatting, type checking, tests, and enforcement hooks/CI.
- UNKNOWN: external CI system outside repo (e.g., hosted pipeline config not checked into this workspace) could still enforce checks.

# Decisions made

- Ran `yarn lint` to verify effective ESLint pass/fail status instead of relying only on config files.
- Ran `yarn test` as a secondary quality gate signal because tests are often part of standards enforcement.
- Ran `yarn tsc --noEmit` to check whether strict TypeScript compiles cleanly in current state, even though no dedicated script exists.
- Checked for automation mechanisms (`.github/workflows`, `.husky`) to determine whether standards are enforced pre-commit or in CI from this repo.
- Chose not to modify lint/type config because request was inspection-only.

# Artifacts

- Files inspected:
- `package.json`
- `.eslintrc.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- Commands executed and outcomes:
- `yarn lint` => PASS, “No ESLint warnings or errors”.
- `yarn test` => PASS, 2 test files / 20 tests passed.
- `yarn tsc --noEmit` => PASS (no type errors emitted).
- `test -d .github` => missing in repo root.
- `test -d .husky` => missing in repo root.
- Minimal diff summary:
- Added handoff note: `.focal/docs/handoffs/2026-02-14/handoff-Q4nT8zLm.mdx`.

# If we resume

- Start by deciding desired enforcement baseline (lint + typecheck + tests + formatter) and whether to gate on pre-commit, CI, or both.
- Add explicit `typecheck` script and optionally split lint scopes (e.g., `lint:fix`).
- Add formatting standard (Prettier or equivalent) and define config/ignore files.
- Add repository-local automation (`.husky` + `lint-staged`) if pre-commit gating is desired.
- Add CI workflow in `.github/workflows` to enforce checks on PRs; if external CI is used, document it in-repo (UNKNOWN currently).
